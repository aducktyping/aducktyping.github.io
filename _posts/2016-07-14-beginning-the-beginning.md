This is the beginning of the beginning. Well, not entirely. I've been kicking around the idea of getting into data science for probably a couple years now. The moment I first heard the term "data scientist" I thought "oh, that's kinda what I'm doing already". About five years ago I realized how awesome the Python open source scientific computing stack is, and I have been using it ever since off-and-on for my own work in my career. However, I always seem to find the manipulation and analysis of data more interesting than the work for which I am collecting data. Perhaps this is a good sign that data science is for me... and in any event, my current career has run its course and I'm eager to do something very different. So yesterday I made the decision I was going to go for it. I'm going to attempt to self-teach myself the equivalent (more-or-less) of a masters degree in data science.

First things first, I need to put together a curriculum for myself. Fortunately there are at least a couple of examples out there already I can start with:

* [Open Source Society Data Science](https://github.com/open-source-society/data-science)
* [The Open Source Data Science Masters](https://github.com/datasciencemasters/go)

I'm going to use these sample curriulae to design a program for myself that I will keep track of on this site as I make progress.
